# Object-Detection-and-Distance-Estimation-using-YoloV4

This repository contains an IoT-based object detection and distance estimation system using YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once). The system is divided into two main parts:
1. **Front-end:** Displays detected objects and estimated distances using a Flask application that fetches data from a Firebase Firestore database.
2. **Back-end:** Detects objects in real-time and estimates their distance using the YOLOv4 model. The back-end also updates the Firestore database and triggers alerts if objects are too close.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv4.
- Distance estimation of detected objects based on known object sizes.
- Alerts when objects are detected within a predefined distance threshold.
- Firebase integration for storing and displaying detection data.
- Flask front-end to visualize detected objects and their distances.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language.
- Flask: Web framework for the front-end.
- YOLOv4: Object detection algorithm.
- OpenCV: Image processing library.
- Firebase Firestore: Cloud database for storing detected object data.
- Firebase Admin SDK: For accessing Firestore in Python.
- Tkinter: GUI for running the back-end application.
- Pygame: For playing alert sounds.

## Setup Instructions
### Front-end Setup
1. Install the required packages:

```bash
Copy code
pip install flask firebase-admin
Configure Firebase:
```

Add your Firebase credentials in chandu_key.json (this should contain your Firebase admin SDK key).
Make sure the Firestore database is properly configured with a collection named Object Detection and Distance Estimation.
Run the Flask App:

bash
Copy code
python front_end.py
Back-end Setup
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask opencv-python numpy firebase-admin pygame pillow
Download YOLOv4 Model:

Place the yolov4-tiny.weights and yolov4-tiny.cfg files in the root directory.
Configure Firebase:

Add your Firebase credentials in chandu_key.json.
Run the Back-end Application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Additional Files
Classes File: The classes.txt file contains the names of objects that YOLOv4 can detect. It should be located in the root directory.
Alert Sound: An alert_sound.mp3 file is played when an object crosses the distance threshold.
Demo Video: The repository contains a demo video (demo.mp4) demonstrating the detection and distance estimation in action.
How It Works
Front-end:

The front-end Flask application fetches object detection data from the Firestore database and displays it in a web interface.
Each detected object is listed with its timestamp and the estimated distance.
Back-end:

The back-end application uses a live camera feed to detect objects using the YOLOv4 model.
The distance to each detected object is calculated based on known object sizes.
Detected objects within a certain distance threshold trigger an alert sound.
Object detection data (name, distance, timestamp) is stored in the Firebase Firestore database.
Object Detection:

The YOLOv4-tiny model is used for detecting objects.
The system calculates distance using a combination of known object dimensions (e.g., person width, vehicle width) and the focal length.
Distance Calculation:

Focal length is determined using reference images.
Distances are calculated for each detected object based on their width in pixels and the known dimensions of the object.
